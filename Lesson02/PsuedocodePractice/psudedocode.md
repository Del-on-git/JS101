# Overview
<p>
  The programs in this subdirectory are intended to be a demonstration of the
  practice of using psuedocode to develop solutions to small problems. Each
  program does one of the following:
  - return the sum of two numbers
  - return the result of concatenating an array of strings
  - given an array of integers, return a new array with every other element
